## WARNING:
Unstyle only protects you against certain types of authorship attribution
methods. Although there are future plans to support the best known method of
authorship attribution, Unstyle currently uses a much simpler model. As such,
even though you will be anonymized against our simpler model, a more
sophisticated model could be used to unmask your identity.

## About Unstyle
Unstyle is an application intended to help users publish anonymous writings.

## Running Unstyle
1. Clone the repository.
3. Install dependencies listed in `DEPENDENCIES`. In the near future, this will
   be done by a setup script.
2. Run `python3 main.py`

## Contributing

Pull requests are both welcome and encouraged. For an overview of how Unstyle
works, refer to my thesis. (Thesis will be linked here on April 3rd)

Not sure where to start? We are in the process of migrating our bugtracker from
Bitbucket. In the meantime, try this in the root directory:

`grep -nr "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX" . | less`
