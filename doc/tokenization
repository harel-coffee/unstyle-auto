TOKENIZATION
    The process of tokenization inludes the following steps in order:
        1. Replacing all hyphens with spaces.
        2. Splitting all words by spaces.
        3. Removing all punctuation, including commas.
    For example:
        "Hi, I'm a test sentence. See?"
        becomes
        ["Hi", "I'm", "a", "test", "sentence", "See"]
